Here is a resume if you did not check it: *[Reminder] -> just click and check them)*


I can use this list of programs.

1. Photoshop: for editing and compositing images, creating concept art and 2D animation.
2. Zbrush: for sculpting, is my favourite program.
3. Maya: 3D Modeling, rendering, 3D animation, etc.
4. 3DMax: 3D Modeling.
5. Unity: i can program in C# a little bit, just to make simple things work and to understand the hell of adventure are programmers going in. i know how to work with the 6. engine too, for making animations, games, rendering, vfx and illumination.
7. Unreal Engine: currently working on it, learning and enjoying it a lot. But for the moment, just the basics.

I am open to work in new interesting projects. I love to work in team.

Have a great day!
